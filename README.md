# Data_Collection
This assignment is divided in two parts
Part 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News
Here we visit the Mars news site and then we create a Beautiful Soup object to extract the text elements we will need from the web site. 
We stored each titles and preview pair in a Python dictionary finally we stored all the dictioanries in a "phyton list" and then we printed that lost in our Jupyter Notebook.
Part 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data:
After we visited the Mars Temperature Data Site and created a Beautiful Soup object we scraped the data into a Pandas DataFrame. Then we analized our dataset using Pandas function and create all the required graphics, finally we export our DataFrame to a CSV file.
